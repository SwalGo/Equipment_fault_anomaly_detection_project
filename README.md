# Equipment_fault_anomaly_detection_project
This project aims to detect anomalies in equipment performance using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Autoencoder. The dataset used comprises vibrational readings from four bearings, simulating real-world scenarios where early fault detection is critical for maintenance and operational efficiency.
